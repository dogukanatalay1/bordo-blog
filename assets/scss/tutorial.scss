/*
ABSTRACTS contains no actual styles, just Sass mechanisms that help define
styles in other directories (sometimes called "helpers"). This includes things like global variables,
functions, and mixins. Each of these categories should be placed in their own appropriately-named partial file, as seen above.
- - -
VENDORS contains any third-party stylesheets a project uses. For instance,
if we wanted to use Bootstrap alongside our own custom Sass in a project,
we'd download the Bootstrap stylesheet and place it here.
- - -
BASE contains boilerplate used throughout an entire si te.
This includes project-wide typography styles, and stylesheets that universally reset or normalize default CSS.
- - -
LAYOUT contains styles for different aspects of the site's structural
layout (think of areas like nav bars, headers, footers, etc.)
- - -
COMPONENTS are like "mini" layouts. Styles for small, reusable pieces of the site
should reside here (think buttons, forms, profile pictures, etc.)
- - -
PAGES is where page-specific styles reside. For instance, if a project contained several
style rules that are only ever used on the "Contact Us" page, they'd live here in a _contact.scss file, as seen above.
